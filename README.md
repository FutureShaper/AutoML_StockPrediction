Additional note:

While H2O’s AutoML does automate many aspects of the machine learning process, it does expect that the data you provide is already cleaned and preprocessed. This includes handling missing values, which some algorithms are not equipped to deal with.

The term “AutoML” can be a bit misleading in this regard. While it does automate the process of training and tuning a variety of models, it doesn’t necessarily include all aspects of the data science pipeline. Data cleaning and preprocessing is often a complex task that requires specific domain knowledge and understanding of the data. Therefore, it’s typically handled separately before using AutoML.

That being said, it would be helpful if H2O’s AutoML could handle missing values automatically in a way that’s optimal for each algorithm. This is an area where machine learning tools continue to evolve and improve.
